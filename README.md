## General Information
      
-As a large consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a **financial loss for the company

## Business Objectives

1.Our aim of this case study is identifying risky loan applicants (defaulters) which will not repay the loan, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of risky loan applicants which represent a chance of loss to the company using explaratory data analysis.

2.After idnetifying those variables the we will inform the company with the findings of analysis and understand the driving factors significant variables behind loan default. 

3.Then the company will be able to utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and credit risk assessment.

## Features used to make an effecient credit risk analysis: to be able to identify the significant features of a defualter to build the analysis upon:
-The “5 Cs of Credit” are as follows: 

    --Character – This refers to the creditworthiness of the borrower based on their previous records and repayment history.

    --Capacity – The repayment capacity of the borrower is determined by his income, profession, and other probable wealth they might possess. 

    --Collateral – Here, a borrower needs to pledge an asset as a guarantee in order to be able to receive the desired amount of loan. The amount of loan given out is also determined by the value of the collateral.

    --Capital – This refers to the overall wealth that the borrower possesses.
    
    --Conditions – This is the final step of the transaction where specifications of the transaction like the amount leaded, rate of interest, monthly repayment amount, etc is calculated based on the above factors for the borrower.
